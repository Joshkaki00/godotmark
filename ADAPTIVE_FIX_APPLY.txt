🐛 ADAPTIVE QUALITY FIX - APPLY NOW
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM:
  Your RPi5 runs at ~36 FPS, but the adaptive quality system was configured
  for 60 FPS systems. It had two bugs:
  
  1. UPGRADE_FPS = 40 (your 36 FPS is below this, so it never upgraded!)
  2. Frame-based hysteresis (assumes 60 FPS, broken at other framerates)

THE FIX:
  ✅ Lowered UPGRADE_FPS to 33 (now 36 FPS can upgrade!)
  ✅ Lowered MIN_FPS to 25 (better threshold for ARM SBCs)
  ✅ Changed to TIME-BASED hysteresis (works at any framerate!)
  
  Now it will:
  - Upgrade after 3 seconds above 33 FPS ✅
  - Downgrade after 2 seconds below 25 FPS ✅
  - Work perfectly at 36 FPS, 60 FPS, or any framerate ✅

================================================================================
🔨 REBUILD ON YOUR RPI5 (Copy-paste these commands):
================================================================================

cd /mnt/exfat_drive/dev/godotmark-project/godotmark

# Clean old build
scons -c
rm -f bin/libgodotmark.linux.template_release.arm64.so

# Rebuild with fix
scons platform=linux arch=arm64 target=template_release cpu=rpi5 -j4

# Run
cd ..
./Godot_v4.4-stable_linux.arm64 --path godotmark

================================================================================
🧪 TESTING THE FIX
================================================================================

After launching:

1. Press 'V' to enable verbose logging
2. Watch the console output
3. You should see (after ~3 seconds each):

   [AdaptiveQuality] Above target for 1.0s (FPS: 36.0)
   [AdaptiveQuality] Above target for 2.0s (FPS: 36.0)
   [AdaptiveQuality] FPS above 33.0 for 3.0s → Upgrading to High
   ... (wait 3 more seconds)
   [AdaptiveQuality] FPS above 33.0 for 3.0s → Upgrading to Ultra

4. Now it's actually ADAPTING! 🎉

================================================================================
📊 WHAT TO EXPECT
================================================================================

With empty scene (current):
  • Medium → High → Ultra (upgrades because stable at 36 FPS)
  • No performance difference (nothing to render yet)

Once we add 3D stress test scenes:
  • Will upgrade when FPS > 33 for 3 seconds
  • Will downgrade when FPS < 25 for 2 seconds
  • Thermal throttle at 75°C (immediate downgrade)

================================================================================
🚀 READY TO REBUILD!
================================================================================

The code changes are already made in:
  • godotmark/src/benchmarks/adaptive_quality_manager.h
  • godotmark/src/benchmarks/adaptive_quality_manager.cpp

Just run the rebuild commands above on your RPi5!
