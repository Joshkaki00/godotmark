❌ LIBRARY NOT FOUND - DIAGNOSIS NEEDED
================================================================================

The error says:
  "ERROR: GDExtension dynamic library not found"

But the build log showed:
  "scons: done building targets."

This is contradictory! Let's find out what's happening.

================================================================================
🔍 RUN THESE COMMANDS TO DIAGNOSE (Copy-paste all):
================================================================================

cd /mnt/exfat_drive/dev/godotmark-project/godotmark

echo "=== 1. Check bin directory ==="
ls -lh bin/

echo ""
echo "=== 2. Look for ANY .so files ==="
find . -name "*.so" -ls

echo ""
echo "=== 3. Check what .gdextension expects ==="
cat godotmark.gdextension | grep arm64

echo ""
echo "=== 4. Check if library exists ==="
test -f bin/libgodotmark.linux.template_release.arm64.so && echo "✅ EXISTS" || echo "❌ DOES NOT EXIST"

echo ""
echo "=== 5. Check last 20 lines of build log ==="
tail -20 build.log

echo ""
echo "=== 6. Look for linking errors ==="
grep -i "error\|failed\|cannot" build.log | tail -10

📋 PASTE THE FULL OUTPUT HERE
================================================================================

This will tell us:
  1. Does the bin/ directory exist?
  2. Was the .so file created at all?
  3. Was it created in the wrong location?
  4. Did linking actually succeed?

================================================================================
🤔 POSSIBLE CAUSES:
================================================================================

1. Build failed during LINKING phase (after compilation succeeded)
2. Library created in wrong directory
3. Filesystem issue (exFAT permissions?)
4. Out of disk space
5. Build script showed wrong "success" message

================================================================================
🔧 IF LIBRARY DOESN'T EXIST:
================================================================================

The build might have failed during the linking phase. We need to:

1. Clean everything:
   cd /mnt/exfat_drive/dev/godotmark-project/godotmark
   scons -c
   rm -rf bin/*.so

2. Rebuild with verbose output:
   scons platform=linux arch=arm64 target=template_release -j4 verbose=yes 2>&1 | tee build_verbose.log

3. Check the verbose log:
   grep -i "linking\|error\|failed" build_verbose.log
